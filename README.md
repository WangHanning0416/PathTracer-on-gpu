Rendering is the conversion process of a 3D model into a 2D image.
Based on the contents of the three-gpu-pathtracing project, I focused on implementing the path tracing algorithm for image rendering. 
In addition, other factors can also affect the rendering quality of the model, such as roughness, metalness, refraction, glossiness, and so on. 
These findings are presented in the later sections of the report.
